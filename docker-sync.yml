  # optional, default: docker-compose-dev.yml if you like, you can set a custom location (path) of your compose file. Do not set it, if you do not want to use it at all

  # ADVANCED: the image to use for the rsync container. Do not change this until you exactly know, what you are doing

  # optional, default auto, can be docker-sync, thor or auto and defines how the sync will be invoked on the cli. Mostly depending if your are using docker-sync solo, scaffolded or in development ( thor )

  # optional, maximum number of attempts for unison waiting for the success exit status. The default is 5 attempts (1-second sleep for each attempt). Only used in unison.

  # optional, default: pwd, root directory to be used when transforming sync src into absolute path, accepted values: pwd (current working directory), config_path (the directory where docker-sync.yml is found)
